## Next

* Add basic data structures: `Node`, `IntegerNode`, `Edge` (undirected), `Graph`.
* Add basic typedefs: `AdjacencyList`, `EdgeList`, `NodeLayout`.
* Add abstract class `StaticLayoutAlgorithm`, which represents a generic static layout algorithm.
* Add abstract class `InteractiveLayoutAlgorithm`, which represents a generic interactive layout algorithm.
* Add force directed algorithm `Eades`, with support for constrained (fixed) nodes.
* Add static force directed algorithm `FruchtermanReingold`.
